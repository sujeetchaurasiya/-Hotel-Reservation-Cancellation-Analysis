## Introduction
Hotel reservations are often canceled due to various reasons, impacting the hotel's revenue and operations. This project aims to analyze the data related to hotel reservation cancellations and uncover insights to help mitigate this issue.
This analysis focuses on understanding and addressing the high cancellation rates observed in both city and resort hotels in recent years. The problem has significant implications, leading to decreased revenues and suboptimal room utilization. By examining the reservation status counts, we aim to identify patterns and factors contributing to cancellations, thereby providing insights to mitigate these issues.
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about hotel reservations, including booking details, customer demographics, and cancellation status. The data is available in the `hotelBooking.csv` file of this repository.

## Installation
To run the analysis, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Additionally, you need to install the necessary Python libraries, which are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
Clone the repository:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/sujeetchaurasiya/Hotel-Reservation-Cancellation-Analysis.git
```
## Objectives
Identify Key Factors: Determine the main factors contributing to reservation cancellations.

Predict Cancellations: Develop a predictive model to forecast the likelihood of a reservation being canceled.

Optimize Room Utilization: Provide recommendations to improve room allocation and utilization based on predicted cancellations.

Increase Revenue: Suggest strategies to minimize cancellations and maximize revenue.
